### Introduction
The purpose of this lab session is get experience working with HTML5 Canvas images and to learn transformation.

Please notice this lab is mostly a reformat of the original one, Lab No. 3â€“HTML5 Images, Videos and Transformation, in an attempt to go step by step and provide insight on the effect of specific lines of code.

### Setup

1. Open [index.html](index.html) file in Firefox.
2. Open [index.html](index.html) files in a text editor (i.e. gedit, sublime, atom, etc.).
3. Explore the developer tools and console (Ctrl-Shift-K) in Firefox.


### Draw an image

1. Download a [red panda image](https://live.staticflickr.com/7423/16339195416_3d3619c4dd_c_d.jpg) and save it in this folder with the name `red_panda.jpg`
2. Draw the image into the canvas as follows:

```
var imageObj = new Image();
imageObj.onload=function() {
  var destX = canvas.width / 2 - this.width / 2;
  var destY = canvas.height / 2 - this.height / 2;
  ctx.drawImage(this, destX, destY);
  console.log(destX, destY);
  console.log(this.width/2, this.height/2);
};
imageObj.src="./red_panda.jpg"
```

Note the image is centered within the canvas. This is achieved by "aligning" the centres of both the canvas and the image (see variables `destX` and `destY`).

### Crop an image

1. Comment the line:

```
ctx.drawImage(this, destX, destY);
```

2. Check the syntax for image clipping. [HTML canvas drawImage() Method](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_drawimage.asp):

```
context.drawImage(img, sx, sy, swidth, sheight, x, y, width, height);
```

* `img` is the image, canvas or video to use
* `sx` and `sy` are the coordinates where start the clipping
* `swidth` and `sheight` are the width and height of the clipped image
* `x` and `y` are the coordinates where to place the image on the canvas
* `width` and `height` are the width and height of the image to use

3. Change the body of `imageObj.onload=function()` accordingly in order to crop the red panda image. Example:

```
clipX = 50;
clipY = 50;
clipWidth = 150;
clipHeight= 150;
ctx.drawImage(this, clipX, clipY, clipWidth, clipHeight, destX, destY, clipWidth, clipHeight);
```

4. Consider varying the positions of the above to create different sets of cropped image

### Save the canvas data as an image

1. Add an image tag in the body of your webpage.

```
<img id="canvasImg"/>
```

2. Grab the content of the canvas as (after the image is drawn):

```
var canvasContent = canvas.toDataURL();
```

3. Assign the canvas content to the image element:

```
document.getElementById("canvasImg").src = canvasContent;
```

### Transform objects on canvas

1. Draw the whole red panda image by commenting the clipping and uncommenting the original draw

2. Check the syntax for canvas transformations. [HTML canvas transform() Method](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_transform.asp):

```
a 	c 	e
b 	d 	f
0 	0 	1
```

* `a` and `d` represent horizontal and vertical scaling, respectively
* `b` and `c` represent horizontal and vertical skewing, respectively
* `e` and `f` represent horizontal and vertical moving, respectively

<font color='red'>**Note:**</font> The `transform()` method behaves relatively to other transformations made by `rotate()`, `scale()`, `translate()`, or `transform()`. Check the APIs of these methods too.

3. Rescale the image on the canvas to half its size using `transform()` method:

```
ctx.transform(0.5, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0);
```

4. Now rescale the image on the canvas using the `scale()` method:

```
ctx.scale(2, 2);
```

5. Rotate the image on the canvas using the `rotate()` method:

```
ctx.rotate(20 * Math.PI / 180);
```
